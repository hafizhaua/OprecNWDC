            <p>Hello, folks!<br>Meet me, <b>Hafizha Ulinnuha Ahmad</b>.</p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               I'm a first year student in UGM's Information Engineering. To be honest, I'm pretty new in IT stuffs. So reaching and trying to find
               what I'm really interested in is my number one goal. I've been trying to learn a bit about competitive programming and (very) little
               about web development. They are pretty fun yet challenging, though. It may be that I'm a little too late compared to others, but (katanya) tidak ada
               kata terlambat dalam belajar, bukan?
            </p>

            <h1>What am I using?</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Well, in this website, I'm only using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, though. 
                No frameworks including Bootstrap, nothing except HTML and CSS simply because I haven't learned that [sadreact]. 
                But I hope soon I will! Anyway, for the code editor, I'm using <b>Visual Studio Code</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you may know (or not), 
                this website hasn't been that responsive. The mobile view is such a mess. Zooming in or out is not a recommendation. 
                Just.. don't zoom.. , please?</p>

            <h1>Why do I choose NWDC?</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                According to those techstack(s) that I've been using for this website, it's undenied that there's <b>still a lot of stuffs
                to learn</b>. In this web development learning journey, I really hope to have someone to be 
                <b>a place</b> for me <b>to ask and learn more</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining NWDC means getting ready to be surrounded by many insightful 
                and passionate people. So I think <b>it's a perfect place to boost up</b> my knowledge about IT journey, esp. web development.</p>

            <h1>What is Frontend and Backend?</h1>
            <p>
                Front-end and Back-end are <b>complementary</b>
                in web developing.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front-end is literally something related to "front",
                meaning it can be said as developing what users will see in "front" of (in this context)
                a website or browser. Hence, it's usually called as "client-side" development.
                It's basically <b>developing what clients/users will see or interact with</b> on a website.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Back-end is "server-side" development.
                Ever curious about where your submitted data of presensi go? Back-end is basically the one who manages such data flows.
                It <b>develops everything related to servers and databases</b>. Hence, it can be said as the "engine" of
                a website.
